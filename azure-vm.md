#### Azure virtual networks VNet
Virtual networks (VNets) are used in Azure to provide private connectivity between Azure Virtual Machines and other Azure services. 
VMs and services that are part of the same virtual network can access one another.
By default, services outside the virtual network cannot connect to services within the virtual network.
